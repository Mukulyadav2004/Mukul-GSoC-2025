## **Overview**

Being part of Google Summer of Code this year has been an incredible experience. I’m immensely grateful to my mentor for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and for the guidance provided along the way. This journey has significantly boosted my coding skills and confidence, allowing me to explore new areas of software development.

As a student, balancing academic responsibilities with my commitment to this project has been challenging, yet rewarding. The experience taught me valuable time management skills, as I dedicated evenings and weekends to contributing to the project. The support and flexibility offered by my mentor were essential in helping me navigate these challenges.

Overall, my first Google Summer of Code has been about more than just writing code; it’s been a journey of learning, adaptation, and growth. I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned to continue improving the project and to contribute more to the open-source community.
