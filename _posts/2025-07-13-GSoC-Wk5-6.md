# GSoC Week 5–6 Progress: Named Vectors, Added Classed Error Conditions, and Clear Docs

Hi everyone!

Here’s my progress update covering **Weeks 5 and 6 of GSoC**. These two weeks have been focused on usability and developer experience improvements in `data.table`. While they weren’t about deep C-level work, they helped make things easier and clearer for both users and developers.

## Row Names from Named Vectors in `data.table()` — Now Supported!

One of the things I worked on was adding **row name extraction for named vectors** when using:

```r
data.table(x = named_vector, keep.rownames = TRUE)
```

Before this change, `keep.rownames` only worked for matrix or `data.frame` inputs, but not for plain named vectors. That wasn’t consistent with how `data.frame()` behaves.

After some discussion in the issue page, I introduced logic in `as.data.table.list()` to:

* Detect the first named atomic vector in the input.
* Extract its names as a new column called `"rn"` or a custom name.
* Remove the names from the vector to avoid duplication.

### Example

Here’s what it looks like now:

```r
data.table(x = setNames((1:12)^3, month.abb), keep.rownames = TRUE)
```

**Before:**

```
         x
     <num>
 1:     1
 2:     8
...
12:  1728
```

**After:**

```
        rn     x
    <char> <num>
 1:    Jan     1
...
12:    Dec  1728
```

It’s a small thing, but it smooths out an edge case for people coming from base R. You can check out **PR #7103** for full details.

## Smarter, Programmatic Error Handling with Classed Conditions

Another thing I focused on was making `data.table` errors **easier to work with in R scripts**.

Right now, `data.table` users can catch errors using `tryCatch(..., error = ...)`. But there wasn’t an easy way to distinguish between different types of errors without parsing error messages.

### What I Added

In **PR #7134**, I added four new strategic condition classes:

* `dt_missing_column_error`
* `dt_unsortable_type_error`
* `dt_join_type_mismatch_error`
* `dt_invalid_input_error`

### How to Use It

Now users can catch specific error types like this:

```r
tryCatch({
  some_data_table_code()
}, dt_missing_column_error = function(e) {
  message("A specific column was missing!")
})
```

This builds on the infrastructure introduced in an earlier PR with `raise_condition()`. And just like we did before, I added a dedicated help page:

```r
?datatable-condition-classes
```

### Documentation and Linter

A new linter under `.ci/linters/rd/` ensures all condition classes are properly documented — same idea as what we did for `data.table-options` earlier. This sets things up so that as new error classes get added in the future, the docs and code will stay in sync automatically.

## Fixing Long-Standing Help Text Confusion with `with=`

Finally, I tackled a smaller but meaningful **documentation improvement** in **PR #7155**.

The help page for `data.table()` had a confusing statement that said:

> "x\[, cols] is equivalent to x\[, ..cols]..."

That’s not actually true.

* `x[, cols]` literally looks for a column called `"cols"` in `data.table`.
* Only `x[, ..cols]` or `x[, cols, with=FALSE]` correctly look up a variable `cols` in the parent environment.

### What I Changed

So I rewrote that section of the help text to:

* Remove the incorrect equivalence claim.
* Add clearer, up-to-date examples showing how to handle dynamic column selection in `data.table`.

Even though it’s not a code change, keeping documentation clear and accurate is just as important, especially for a widely used package like `data.table`.

## Closing Thoughts

Weeks 5–6 felt really productive. Instead of just fixing one-off issues, I got to work on things that improve the **overall developer experience** for `data.table` — from smarter error handling to clearer documentation to smoother named vector behavior.

Next up, I’m looking forward to tackling some deeper technical tasks. Thanks for reading and following along!
