## Improving Docs and Exploring Performance in data.table
**PR:** #7075 - [Add central documentation page for data.table options](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7075)
**Fixes:** #6720 - [List Of data.table Options](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/6720)

This week, I worked on solving an important usability problem in the data.table ecosystem: the lack of a single, centralized help page listing all user-configurable options. Although data.table provides numerous powerful `datatable.*` options to control printing, performance, memory, and debugging behavior, these were previously undocumented in one place — making them difficult for users to discover, understand, and use confidently.

## Problem Overview
Many users may be familiar with options like:

- `datatable.verbose` – to print verbose progress
- `datatable.auto.index` – to enable/disable automatic indexing
- `datatable.alloccol` – to control memory reallocation behavior

...but they were scattered across various help files (`?data.table`, `?fread`, `?set`, etc.), GitHub issues, or hidden in the source code. As a result, it was difficult for users to:

- Know which options exist
- Understand what they control
- See their default and current values
- Learn about interdependencies between them

## What I Did – A Two-Part Solution
To address this comprehensively, I structured the PR into two stages:

### 1. A Centralized Help Page – `?data.table-options`
I created a new `.Rd` file:
`man/data.table-options.Rd`

This introduces a new help topic:

```r
help("data.table-options")
```

This page includes:

- A complete list of all `datatable.*` options
- Grouped thematically (e.g. printing, verbose/debug, performance tuning)
- Each entry includes:
  - Option name
  - Default value
  - Actual current value (when relevant)
  - Clear purpose/description

This now serves as an official reference point for users, contributors, and maintainers alike — a place to learn and understand how to configure data.table behavior without needing to dig into source code.

### 2. A CI Linter to Enforce Sync Between Docs and Code
Documentation can quickly become stale if not enforced. So I added a custom linter to automatically check for consistency between:

- The options used in code (`getOption("datatable.*")`)
- And the ones listed in the help file (`data.table-options.Rd`)

This linter was implemented as a new script:
`.ci/linters/rd/options_doc_check.R`

It is now run as part of the CI (Continuous Integration) test pipeline.

The linter:

- Extracts all documented `datatable.*` options
- Statistically scans source files for any use of `getOption("datatable.*")`
- Compares the two lists
- Fails the CI if any option used in code is missing from the help page

This ensures that all options are properly documented going forward, without relying on manual effort.

### Bonus – A Future-Ready Linting Framework
While implementing this check, I created a dedicated directory:
`.ci/linters/rd/`

The idea is not just to lint option documentation, but to establish a framework where other `.Rd`-related checks can be added over time.

This opens up possibilities like:

- Checking for outdated or missing examples
- Validating title/description formatting
- Ensuring consistent usage of `@seealso`, `@details`, and other Rd tags

So this isn’t just a one-time fix — it’s an investment in automated documentation quality for the long-term need of project.

### How Feedback Helped Improve the Final Design
Throughout the review process, I received detailed feedback from mentors and contributors including:

- Clarifying ambiguous option descriptions
- Improving grouping (e.g. printing-related options together)
- Renaming some options for consistency in doc
- Improving detection of edge cases in the linter logic

This collaboration helped me better understand the project’s coding standards, documentation philosophy, and how thoughtful review can make even a small feature significantly better.

### Final Result
- The help page is now merged and live:  
  Try `?data.table-options` in R!
- The linter runs with every PR via GitHub Actions
- The documentation is now discoverable, comprehensive, and self-maintaining
- Future contributors modifying or adding new options will be reminded to document them, or their PR will fail CI

## Improving `fread()` Reliability with Safer Error Handling

**PR:** #7097 – [Improve error messages for system command and decompression failures in `fread()`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/7097) 
**Fixes:** #5415 - [fread should raise an error instead of a warning when reading a gzipped file that does not fit in temporary storage](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/5415)

### Problem Overview

`fread()` is one of data.table’s most widely used functions, known for its speed and flexibility in reading large datasets — including support for reading compressed files and using external shell commands via the `cmd=` argument.

However, there being two silent failure modes that could result in corrupted data or incomplete reads, without clearly alerting users:

#### Failure Mode 1: Decompression Failures

If `fread()` attempts to read a gzipped file using `R.utils::decompressFile()`, and the decompression fails silently (e.g., due to insufficient disk space), the function may still proceed and try to read a truncated file, leading to:

- Partial data reads
- Incomplete tables
- Hard-to-debug downstream issues

#### Failure Mode 2: Broken Shell Commands (`cmd=`)

When users provide a custom system command (e.g., `cmd = "gunzip -c myfile.csv.gz"`), and that command fails (e.g., file not found, or command not installed), `fread()` used to ignore the non-zero exit status and still try to read from the result — often yielding an empty or corrupted result.

### What I Did – Making Failures Loud, Not Silent

The aim of this PR was to ensure these critical failure paths are caught early and communicated clearly to users, rather than being silently ignored.

Here’s how I fixed both failure cases:

#### 1. Safer Decompression with `tryCatch()`

Previously, `R.utils::decompressFile()` was called without any error handling. I wrapped this in `tryCatch()` and introduced a detailed error message if decompression fails. The message now:

- Explains that decompression failed
- Suggests checking for disk space
- Mentions the temporary directory (`tmpdir`) where decompression is attempted

This prevents `fread()` from moving forward with a broken intermediate file and makes the likely cause obvious.

#### 2. Validating System Command Exit Codes

Shell commands passed via the `cmd=` argument are now monitored for their exit status. If a command returns a non-zero exit code:

- `fread()` now throws an error
- The error includes the exit code and a message advising users to check the command syntax or availability

This stops `fread()` from silently processing garbage output (e.g., when `cmd` fails to open the file or isn't installed).

#### 3. Preventing File Leaks with Early `on.exit()`

In both code paths, I also moved the `on.exit(unlink(tmpFile))` call before the system/decompression logic. This ensures that temporary files are always cleaned up, even if an error occurs — avoiding storage leaks in the user’s `tmpdir`.

### Design Philosophy and Mentorship Feedback

This PR benefited from a helpful review discussion with mentors, especially on:

- When to raise warnings vs. errors
- How to design error messages that are both technical and actionable
- Placement of cleanup logic (`on.exit`) to guarantee robustness

These conversations helped me align with data.table's philosophy of fast but predictable behavior, and improved my understanding of R's file handling mechanisms.

### Example: Before vs After

**Corrupted Gzip File Scenario**  
_Before (silent failure, partial read):_
```r
fread("data.csv.gz")
# Would either:
# 1. Read partial/corrupted data without warning
# 2. Fail with a cryptic low-level decompression error
# 3. Return unexpected results silently
```

_After (clear, helpful error):_
```r
fread("data.csv.gz")
# Error: R.utils::decompressFile failed to decompress file 'data.csv.gz'. 
# The file may be corrupted or not a valid gzip file.
```

**Invalid System Command Scenario**  
_Before (unclear error):_
```r
fread(cmd = "invalid-command input.csv")
# Error: could not find function "invalid-command"
# or
# Error: system command failed
# (unclear what went wrong or how to fix it)	
```

_After (clear, helpful error):_
```r
fread(cmd = "invalid-command input.csv")
# Error: External command failed with exit code 127: 'invalid-command input.csv'
# Command not found or failed to execute. Check that the command exists and is accessible.
```

### Outcome and Impact

This change makes `fread()` much more robust in production environments, where:

- Users may not be present to read warnings
- Disk space may be low (e.g., in CI or cloud)
- External commands might be brittle or platform-specific

With clear, fail-fast behavior, users are now alerted immediately when something goes wrong — reducing data corruption risk and debugging time.

## Closing Thoughts

Through both of these tasks, I’ve gained deeper insight into the internals of data.table, worked closely with mentors during review cycles, and sharpened my ability to think from both a developer and user perspective.

Looking forward to continuing with even more technically involved issues in the coming weeks. Thanks for reading and supporting the journey!
